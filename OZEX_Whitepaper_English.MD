### 1.	Block Chain



1.1	Techniques and features of Block Chain

Block Chain is inevitable to mention when people talk about Bitcoin. What is believed is that Block chain leads the change world widely by quickly penetrating all the societies. 
transactions into the ledger over a given period. For that reason, there are many fields interested in this technique, such as finance, trade, distribution, and pharmaceutical industries, and there are specific infrastructures of the blockchain in Samsung SDS, Kakaotalk, and Seoul government. In short, the most advantageous part of the block chain is transparency, and the credibility based on this technique will be the key part for the 4th industrial revolution. Not only transparency, but also unchangeability in terms of the impossibility of changing records of the financial transactions and dispersibility, in which all the participants take part, will be the most advantaged in Blockchain.
Blockchain can be categorised into 3 following:

- Public blockchain: Anyone can participate in the network such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. <BR>
-	Private blockchain:One institution exclusively owns one network <BR>
- Consortium blockchain: Pre-selected group of participants establish a consortium and control the consensus process, but only those authorised participants can take part in the network. So it is called part public, part private. 

Most of blockchains in ICO market are all based on public blockchain. It means anyone can participate in blockchaine networks, and thereby everyone can see all the transactions and verify them. Whereas, the private blockchain is limited to authorised participants and supervisory institutions. Only those who are authorised can access to the transactions, observe the process and only those participants can validate and approve the transactions. Also, it is limited to generate the new transactions as well. For these reasons, anyone can participate in the public blockchain, in which there is no central de facto operators to control the financial process and the participants can choose their own currencies for the financial activities which make them free from the regulations regarding the currencies. Whereas, the actual operators in private blockchain are clear and every transaction is technically based on the existing financial activities, so the participants should comply with the financial law and regulations.

1.2	Blockchain and coins

2In 2008, an article titled [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System] was published under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, and the source for the Bitcoin was publicly distributed in the following year, 2009. According to the article, Satoshi Nakamoto proposed “a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.” and this is now a motto of Blockchain. Afterwards, a variety of alt-coins have been developed including Ethereum, Ripple, LiteCoin, Monero, and etc, and Bitcoin is play a key role among those alt-coins.
The coin, what is called ‘virtual currencies’, will be a familiar name for those who do not have any knowledge of ‘Blockchain’. It can be said that the virtual currencies are the rewards for the participants in the network and it is called ‘Mining’. Regarding to ‘Bitcoin’, a coin is mined with the computer CPU by solving arithmetically mathematical problems and decrypting the ‘code’, and as a result of the mining, a transaction ledger block will be generated. As a reward for this whole process, the miners can earn ‘Bitcoin’, which is called “POW(Proof-of-work)” The coins represented as to have this process are ‘Bitcoin’ and ‘Ethereum’. However, the harder the level of mining becomes, the more computing power you need to contribute to. Because of the drawbacks POW such as high level consumption of electricity and computing power, PoS(Proof-of-stake) has derived as an alternative. Not only PoS, but also there is another alternative to POW, which is “POI(Proof-of-Importance)” and so forth.

1.3	Process

1.3.1	 Cryptocurrency exchange

exchangeable for BTC market), ‘Huobi’ (115coins exchangeable for BTC market), ‘bitfinex’(37 coins exchangeable for BTC market), ‘Okex’ (163 coins exchangeable for BTC market), and ‘Upbit’ (121 coins exchangeable for BTC market and 35 coins for KRW market). Besides that, there are mid side cryptocurrency exchanges by distributing rare or creative coins or tokens in the market.

### 2. OZEX

2.1	What is OZEX?

It is a new compound word of ‘Aussie’ and ‘Exchange’. Australia has Uluru regarded to as the centre of the world and given that, OZEX is named after Aussie (or Oz) and aspires to be the world central coin in the trading market.
<BR><BR>
2.2	Why OZEX is necessary?

As the interest towards cryptocurrency has been increased since 2017, the number of ICO coins has also risen (according to icorating.com, there are 92 ICO coins registered from 2017 to February 2018). In the earliest phase of the ICO, once new coins were listed on the exchanges, the value of those coins was soared up to hundreds of thousands of margins in comparison with their initial value, which apparently attracted more investors exponentially. However the problem of the ICO has been exposed, as more investors got into the exchanges. According to the article “initial coin offerings” which Ernst & Young has produced, more than 10% of ICO proceeds are lost as a result of attacks. As one of the cases, Prodeum based in Lithuania started ICO on 25th of January in 2018 and disappeared at night on 28th. Back then, Prodeum promised to “revolutionise the fruit and vegetable industry” by putting it on the Ethereum blockchain. It sought to raise $US 6.5 million dollars (5,400 ETH worth) and vanished after raising only $US 11 dollars in total from investors in ICO. Another, OneCoin was another example which was once regarded highly as promising and is now turned out to be a Ponzi scheme in April, 2017. Before the exposure, it raised roughly $350 million dollars. In addition, Confido is another example, which raised up to $370,000 and vanished as well. Technically, the trust of companies running ICOs has been very controversial. It is significantly hard to figure out the process of development and the actual potentials of companies running ICOs without visible outcomes. Some of those companies misused the unpredictable situations and disappeared with raised money. Thus there are websites investigating those scams such as https://icoindex.com/index/scam and https://isthiscoinascam.com/ 

 Most of the investors are not experts. Thus, those who are willing to invest should raise their own insight towards companies who run the ICO with clear vision, low possibilities of fraud, rather than consider to maximize the profits. What OZEX provides is following: 

1.	The convenience for ICO investment 
2.	stability for ICO investment
3.	Profitability for ICO investment

 To begin with, when it comes to the convenience for ICO investment, OZEX has a variety of experts who have experienced through all the process from the mining to the trading for many years. OZEX offers you to participate in the ICO with selective coins if you hold OZEX tokens and those coins/tokens and ICOs will be assessed and validate by experts with professional insights. Secondly, in terms of the stability for ICO investment, based on the proven knowhow and consultant delivered by cryptocurrency experts, OZEX evaluates the credibility of the companies and their financial and technical visions. Thirdly, with regards to the profitability, it is general that the price of coins and tokens are increased comparing to the initial price once the coins/tokens are listed on the ICO exchanges. For example, the ROI, Return On Investment, of NEO is 5253% and that of Populous is 3821%, however, there is Nimiq, the ROI of which was -153%. The average ROI ETH, according to icostats.com, is 223%, but it is highly possible that the average ROI can be soaring more up than what is believed if the core vision of company and its marketing fuel it up.
